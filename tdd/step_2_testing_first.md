## Testing first

We will start by writing our specs for the game. First we need to create a test file. All our specs will live in the `spec` folder. Go ahead and create a file named `fizz_buzz_spec.rb`

```shell
$ touch spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb
```

Open it up in your editor and add the following code:

```ruby
require './lib/fizz_buzz'

describe 'fizz_buzz' do
  
end
```
The line at the top means that the tests file will look for source file in the `lib` folder, called `fizz_buzz.rb`. At this moment it will not find that file (we have not created it yet) and return an error.

The following lines is a describe block where we will put our tests. We will return to them shortly. 

First, I want you to return to your terminal and run `rspec` again. I want you to actually see the test fail and get accustomed to the error messages you will be seeing.

```shell
rspec
/Users/thomas/Projects/fizz_buzz/spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:1:in `require': cannot load such file -- ./lib/fizz_buzz (LoadError)
	from /Users/thomas/Projects/fizz_buzz/spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'

	from /Users/thomas/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby_executable_hooks:15:in `eval'
	from /Users/thomas/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/bin/ruby_executable_hooks:15:in `<main>'
```

**Yes, that IS a lot!** But the most important lines are the two on the top:
```text
/Users/thomas/Projects/fizz_buzz/spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:1:in `require': cannot load such file -- ./lib/fizz_buzz (LoadError)
```

Quite often, RSpec is returning a lot of text when we get an error and it can get quite intimidating. One tip is to always look at the top of the output. That is where the important message is. Trust me.

Anyway, RSpec is telling us that there is no file in the `lib` folder called `fizz_buzz.rb`. Let's create that.

```shell
$ mkdir lib
$ touch lib/fizz_buzz.rb
```

So, let's pause for a moment. It is important that we agree on three things at this point. 
1. Your **tests/specs** are placed in the `spec` folder
2. Your **implementation (or production code)** are placed in the `lib` folder
3. Your **settings** (like `Gemfile`, etc.) are placed in the main project folder

Alright?

Moving on... Time to write some tests. 

Let's make some decisions. Let's say that we want a main method in our program that can take a number and return 'fizz', 'buzz', fizzbuzz' or the number if no conditions are met. That is or objective, right?

Add the following `it` block to your test file (make sure to place it **inside** the `describe` block)

```ruby
# spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb

it 'returns '1' if number = 1' do
    expect(fizz_buzz(1)).to eq 1 
end
```

Go back to your terminal and run RSpec. You will get an error:

```shell
rspec

fizz_buzz
  returns '1' if number = 1 (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) fizz_buzz returns '1' if number = 1
     Failure/Error: expect(fizz_buzz(1)).to eq 1
     
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `fizz_buzz' for #<RSpec::ExampleGroups::FizzBuzz:0x007f832ccde158>
     # ./spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00046 seconds (files took 0.1437 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:4 # fizz_buzz returns '1' if number = 1


```
Again, a lot of text, but if you read the message carefully, you'll see that we are getting a `NoMethodError`. We simply don't have a method called `fizz_buzz` in out implementation code.

Let's write the minimum amount of code to make this test pass:

```ruby
# lib/fizz_buzz.rb

def fizz_buzz(number)
  number
end
```

This very simple method takes a number and simply returns it. It makes the test pass - try by running the `rspec` command in your terminal again.

```shell
$ rspec

fizz_buzz
  returns '1' if number = 1

Finished in 0.00215 seconds (files took 0.14163 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

So we asked the program to return '1' if we pass in '1'. All in accordance with the game rules, right? We've written the minimum amount of code needed to make that happen. At this stage we are all good.

But we are far from done, are we? One of the objectives is to return the word `fizz` if the number we pass in is divisible by 3. Let's write a test for that.

```ruby
# spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb

it "returns 'fizz' if number is divisible by 3" do
  expect(fizz_buzz(3)).to eq 'fizz'
end
```

If you run `rspec` again, you'll get an error (of course)

```shell
$ rspec

fizz_buzz
  returns '1' if number = 1
  returns 'fizz' if number is divisible by 3 (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) fizz_buzz returns 'fizz' if number is divisible by 3
     Failure/Error: expect(fizz_buzz(3)).to eq 'fizz'
     
       expected: "fizz"
            got: 3
     
       (compared using ==)
     # ./spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:9:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.0952 seconds (files took 0.13986 seconds to load)
2 examples, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/fizz_buzz_spec.rb:8 # fizz_buzz returns 'fizz' if number is divisible by 3
```

Let's say that we want our implementation to have a some methods that checks if a number is divisible by 3, 5 and 15. Let's also decide on a common naming standard for those methods (remember, it is up to you as a programmer to set your own method names). 

How about:
* `divisible_by_three?`
* `divisible_by_five?`
* `divisible_by_fifteen?`

As good naming convention as any, I would say....

Let's go with that and make use of the Ruby `case` command.
```ruby
# lib/fizz_buzz.rb

def fizz_buzz(number)
  case
    when divisible_by_three?(number) then 'fizz'
    else number
  end
end
```
If modulus (%) is still unclear, try [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5cb_nfDyyM) explaining it visually. Modulus is an important, though confusing, operator to understand.

And we also need to add a `divisible_by_three` method and allow it to take one argument. One way to figure out if a number is divisible by another is to use the modulus operator. Remember, in computing, a modulus operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. If the reminder is `0` then the method returns `true` - if not, it will return `false`.

```ruby
# lib/fizz_buzz.rb

def divisible_by_three?(number)
  number % 3 == 0
end

```
Now, this code will make our second test to pass. Try it.

```shell
$ rspec

fizz_buzz
  returns '1' if number = 1
  returns 'fizz' if number is divisible by 3

Finished in 0.00148 seconds (files took 0.13955 seconds to load)
2 examples, 0 failures
```
### Review and reflect
Okay, so at this point we need to take a step back and review and reflect on what we have done. There is a series of questions you need to ask yourself:
1. How does the `case..when..then` flow control work?
2. Can you come up with another example of flow control that you could have used here?
3. How does the `%` operator work?
4. What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

Some of the answers are available to you in this documentation, some are not. Feel free so search on Google, StackOverflow,etc for answers.
