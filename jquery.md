# jQuery

Forgive us, we're working on this bit at the moment. It's important for you to get an introduction to jQuery in the meantime. A couple of places you might try:

- [Codecademy's JQuery class](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery) (~ 3 hours)
- [W3 School's JQuery Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp)
- And if you find yourself with lots of time and energy to spare, [30 Days to Learn JQuery](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/30-days-to-learn-jquery)

jQuery can be a great lot of fun. Try opening up any website and playing around. Also consider checking out our in-depth introduction from a recent cohort: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaD1vW_mSCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaD1vW_mSCE)
