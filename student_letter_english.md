# Student letter (English)

## Dear future Craft Academy Student

Congratulations for making it to the course. We are really looking forward to helping you find your way as a developer. You will learn a lot, make new friends, be challenged and enthused - you are going to turn your life upside down. Smart move.

This guide is to let you know what we expect of you during your three months at Craft Academy - and what you should expect from yourself. We will also share with you some thoughts about who we are, how we work and what you can expect from us in return.

Please read this document carefully to ensure that you understand what you are getting yourself into and what mindset we want you to take with you when you step through our doors.

Craft Academy was founded to help people get to a level of employability in web development. We do not work in education for education's sake. We train participants so that you will be able to get a well-paying job as a junior developer or build projects in the real world.
