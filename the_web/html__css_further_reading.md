* Extra credit: Install [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) and use it on a new project \(hint: you may want to remove `style.css` from your project first.\) Foundation is a CSS and JQuery framework that comes with a ton of built-in styling. Read the documentation or watch the videos to understand how it works and how to use it in your project. We'll work more with this during the bootcamp.
