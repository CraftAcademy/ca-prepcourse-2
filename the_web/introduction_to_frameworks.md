## Introduction to Frameworks

### What is a Web Framework?
You can think of a web framework as a set of tools designed to simplify your work as a developer. Frameworks exist to save you from having to re-invent the wheel and help alleviate some of the overhead when you're building a new site. Typically frameworks provide libraries for accessing a database, managing sessions and cookies, creating templates to display your HTML and in general, promote the reuse of code.

The difference between a web application and a static web site is persistent data. We use frameworks to manage our databases and access the content stored in them. A static web site does not need to access, write, or delete any data - it simply displays it.

**Think of a framework as a collection of tools, rather than one specific thing.**


### What Can You Do With a Web Framework
Frameworks exist to make building software faster and easier. Typically frameworks provide tools to cover the common CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) cases. For instance, you'll likely find libraries for accessing a database, managing sessions and cookies, creating templates to display your HTML pages and more.

Frameworks also promote the reuse of code. With a good framework you only need to design, for instance, a contact form once. Then you can drop your generic contact form code into all your projects and save yourself some time and effort.

Nearly any site you’re going to build will have to interact with a database. Frameworks generally offer some means of doing so without having to delve into writing your own SQL every time you want to create, read, update or delete a record.

Similarly, most frameworks either provide a template system, or make it easy to add on your own templating system so that common chunks of HTML that rarely change, for instance, the header and footer of your page, need only be written once.

## Sinatra
Sinatra is a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language written in Ruby. Designed and developed by Blake Mizerany in 2007, Sinatra is small and flexible. It does not follow the typical model–view–controller pattern used in other frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails. Instead, Sinatra focuses on "quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort. 
Some notable companies and institutions that use Sinatra include Apple, BBC, the British Government's Government Digital Service, LinkedIn, the National Security Agency, Engine Yard, Heroku, GitHub and Songbird.

## Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby under MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including Convention over Configuration (CoC), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), and the Active Record pattern.

Some of the biggest and most well known sites on the internet are built with Ruby on Rails. GitHub, Airbnb, Shopify, Twitter (in its early days), Groupon, etc have all used this framework as a building block.

## Other frameworks

There are hundreds if not thousands of frameworks available, based on many different programming languages. Many come out every year and many also die. Don't worry so much about mastering the "right" technology. Everyone has a pet project, but understanding how frameworks are structured is the important part. Once you learn one, it will be much easier to learn another.
